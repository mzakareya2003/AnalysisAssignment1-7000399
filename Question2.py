# THEORETICALLY merge sort time complexity is o(nlog(n))
# AND binary search time complexity is O(log(n)) 
# therefore our program using both of these sequentially
# would prove time complexity of O(nlog(n))+O(log(n)) which 
# AND the complexity is the dominant therefore it is theoretically O(nlog(n))
